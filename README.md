# Sketching thingo

Ongoing project using the Leap Motion.
Endgame is to create an app that allows you to sketch something using your finger, in mid air, and have the Leap Motion pass that data through to the browser do it can render what was sketched. Except I keep getting distracted with all the features and ideas!!!!

Checkout it out [here](https://aparkinbotswana.github.io/sketch/)

Note - NEEDS LEAP MOTION TO WORK!
